# Machine_Learning_Projects
This is my ML projects repository
This repository is mainly focused on calcofi data from kaggle. Different ML models will be trained on the same data and in the end I'll compare the models using different metrics.

Below are the regression models I'll be building.
1. Linear Regression
2. Multi Linear Regression
3. Polynomial Regression
4. SVM 
5 Decision Tree
6.Random Forest
